Things did not start off well for my final project. I first chose a project presentation on 'The Rise of Google'. But it was hard to find a call to action on this topic. I took advice from my Professor, TA, and peers and took the bold step to change my topic. I finished everything from start to end within 5 days only with heads down focus and dedication.

### **Introduction**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

### Coronavirus in Texas

Texas is the 11th-most active coronavirus hotspot in the world right now. Since its outbreak in China late last year, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 677,000 people worldwide (as of July 31, 2020). The virusâ€™s rapid spread across the globe has health officials scrambling to contend with the pandemic. What do Texans need to know about the outbreak? 

**How many cases?**

In Texas, cases are soaring. There are now more than 210,000 cases in the Lone Star State. The state reported a record 10,000+ on Tuesday, July 7. Texas joined New York and Florida as the only other states to break the 10,000 daily case threshold. That's more single-day cases than any European nation ever reported at the height of their outbreaks and nearly as much as South Korea has reported the entire pandemic.

![New deaths each day](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67939647/89104761-4a8bce00-d3e1-11ea-9c53-733815a11149.jpg)

### Comparison with other US states

Texas ranked 3rd worst state in U.S. when fighting coronavirus


### Current Hospitalization in Texas

### Ways to conntrol the case counts in Houston

### Why wearing a mask is important?

### My call to action

Appeal to wear masks...

### Interviews

I requested a friend and two family members for an interview to get feedback on my thought process. I shared a spreadsheet with them and noted down their response.
This is how it went:

<img width="687" alt="Interviews" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67939647/89600184-0a847b00-d827-11ea-88fa-b3394e8d1fe3.png">

**Improvements post interview**

So, I recieved quite helpful feedbacks from my interviewees within a very short span of time. Based on their feedbacks I made below changes to my initial plan:

 * Changed the word 'TEXANS' to 'Texans'. I am glad that my sister caught this. Else this would have looked super rude.
 
 * As per my friend's feedback, I included two graphs that showed the United States maps with states border. One showed the confirmed case counts and the other one showed fatalities.
 
 * Another change I did was to remove the tabular chart related to Texas hospital numbers, that did not seem to add a lot of value.
 
 * And finally I added two additional charts to show the ICU bed trends. This seemed like an extremely important area to cover to show the impact.
 
 All these changes are taken care of and shown in the list of charts below that I plan on incorporating in my final story.

**Tools that I am going to use**

For tools related research, I used (Towards Data Science portal) [https://towardsdatascience.com/10-free-tools-to-instantly-get-started-with-data-visualisation-d7fadb5f6dce] that has a list of useful data visualtions tools available for free. There is a short demo gif with each tool shown.

For graphs:

 * [Data Wrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/)
 
 * [Raw Graph](https://rawgraphs.io/)
 
 * [Chart Studio](https://plotly.com/chart-studio/)
 
 * [Flourish Studio](https://flourish.studio/)
 
 * [Canva](https://www.canva.com/graphs/)
 
 **Sources**
 
 I gathered inforamtion, statistics, news, reports, etc. from all the sources below:
 
<img width="374" alt="Sources" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67939647/89600777-6f8ca080-d828-11ea-9dd7-4a9b290d4a88.png">

  
**Putting everything into a story**

 * I spent days and nights compiling everything together and putting it all in the form of a story that would have a call to action value.
 
 * I went through the Shorthand tutorial that was posted in course modules.
 
 * I explored Canva and Inforgram for posters, images, and templates. I somehow felt Canva came as a better to me in terms of the user flexibility and ease of understanding.
 
 * Once I started writing downt the story, after couple of iterations I decided that I wanted to have a black and white theme. The backfround will ne black and the text will be in black.
 
 * There were places where I could not avoid color, so I had to keep them.
 
 * I searched for high quality Corona virus related images to set as Shorthand backdrops.
 
 * I kept most of my graphs in pastel colors, I liked the way they went with the black and whote theme.
 
 * Canva was a life savior in terms of creating amazing posters with symbols, backgrounds, and beautiful fonts.
 
 * I made sure that the content flow made sense and kept my audience engaged.
 
 * Once I finished creating the story, I sent it to my husband and sister for review. I had their green lights.
 
 * Next, I took ten iterations to prepare the talk for my presentation. It was hard to condense close to 20 slides into 5-6 log sentences to be spoken in 60 seconds.
 
 * I rehearsed the prepared talk 3-4 times and I knew I was ready to present my hard work.

============================================================================================

**Please ignore the portion below, this was my initial project idea. But I had to scrap it.**

## **Project Name - The Rise of Google**

### **Introduction**

Google LLCÂ is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which includeÂ online advertising technologies, aÂ search engine,Â cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of theÂ Big FourÂ technology companies alongsideÂ Amazon,Â AppleÂ andÂ Microsoft.

The aim of my story is to show how Google rose amongst the world's topmost companies and show their journey. The story will also highlight various products by Google such as Youtube and Google Play.

**Google's history**

In this section I will gather information about how Google started its journey and what brought it to life. 

### **Next few sections will cover Facts and Statistics about Google's growth**

**Financial analysis of Google**

 * Alphabet's annual revenue from 2002 to 2019.

 * Google's Quarterly revenue from 2008.

 * Google cloud revenue from 2017 to 2019.

 * Google's advertising revenue from 2001 to 2019.

**Google's market value with other companies**

Market capitalization of biggest internet companies.

**Google Advertisement**
This section will show how Google began selling advertising through a program called Google AdWords. It offered marketers the opportunity to purchase relevant keywords that appear next to search results. The revenue from these ad sales helped propel Google to one of the richest companies in the world.

**Google's search engine**

Google's market share of search engine from 2010.

**Google vs. Microsoft Advertising**

This statistic shows the mobile search click share of Google and Microsoft Advertising in the United States as of the first quarter of 2020, sorted by device.Â 

**How Google is brining people together**

In this section I will highligth some of Google's contributions in brining billions and billions of people together on various platforms.

**Closing points / Closing**

Finally, I will all tie this up together to show how Google has changed people's live with its growth and success. What kind of impact does Google have on a normal person's life on a day to day basis.


### **Tools that I plan on using**

 * I shall be documenting my project in Shorthand tool. Their templates allow for elegant and simple stories that any novice could quickly master creating, as well as the option for more technically nuanced approaches to create slick and professional designs.
 
 * To document my ideas and initial sketches, I have used Balsamiq.
 
 * I plan on using Datawrapper and Flourish Studio for final project sketches.

### **Dataset**

I discovered a great website www.statista.com that has quite a lot of dataset for this topic. This website provides free as well as paid data. I am relying on the material that's available for no cost.

So far I have gathered the following datasets that would appropriately fit my story and visuals.

### **Initial sketches / wireframes / visuals**

I used Balsamiq (my latest favorite tool) to frame my ideas in asequence. Please find below the Balsamiq flow that is my wireframe for the initial fraft of this project. It contains my initial sketches and ideas.

I have also added the wireframe as a pdf: ([Data visualization final project wireframe.pdf](https://github.com/ankita-cmu/Data-viz-finalproject/files/4997547/Data.visualization.final.project.wireframe.pdf)
).

### **User research and interviews**

To conduct the interview and research, I picked two of my family members and a friend. I showed them the above Balsamiq project and asked them the interview questions that I had scripted. I have documented the initial setup and interview session below.

**Script and questions:**

I created a wireframe in Balsamiq with the initial sketches and layout of the project and showed to my interviewees. I did not share my project title. I wanted them to guess the topic based on my sketches and visuals. The idea was for them to guess the topic, suggest improvements, and be my critique.

Premise /setup:
Showed a draft presentation of my project visuals and informed that they were looking at my initial sketches of Telling Stories with Data coursework's final project. I created a set of seven interview questions.

 1.  What do you think is the topic of my project?
