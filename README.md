### Tools that I plan on using

I shall be documenting my project in Shorthand tool. Their templates allow for elegant and simple stories that any novice could quickly master creating, as well as the option for more technically nuanced approaches to create slick and professional designs.

### Dataset

I discovered a great website www.statista.com that has quite a lot of dataset for this topic. This website provides free as well as paid data. I am relying on the material that's available for no cost.

So far I have gathered the following datasets that would appropriately fit my story and visuals.

### Initial sketches / wireframes / visuals

I used Balsamiq (my latest favorite tool) to frame my ideas in asequence. Please find below the Balsamiq flow that is my wireframe for the initial fraft of this project. It contains my initial sketches and ideas.

I have also added the wireframe as a pdf: ([Data visualization final project wireframe.pdf](https://github.com/ankita-cmu/Data-viz-finalproject/files/4997547/Data.visualization.final.project.wireframe.pdf)
).

### User research and interviews

To conduct the interview and research, I picked two of my family members and a friend. I showed them the above Balsamiq project and asked them the interview questions that I had scripted. I have documented the initial setup and interview session below.

**Script and questions:**

I created a wireframe in Balsamiq with the initial sketches and layout of the project and showed to my interviewees. I did not share my project title. I wanted them to guess the topic based on my sketches and visuals. The idea was for them to guess the topic, suggest improvements, and be my critique.

Premise /setup:
