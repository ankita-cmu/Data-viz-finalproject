Telling Stories with data final project

## **Project Name - Texans - Wear a Mask**

### **Introduction**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

### Coronavirus in Texas

Texas is the 11th-most active coronavirus hotspot in the world right now. Since its outbreak in China late last year, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 677,000 people worldwide (as of July 31, 2020). The virus’s rapid spread across the globe has health officials scrambling to contend with the pandemic. What do Texans need to know about the outbreak? 

**How many cases?**

In Texas, cases are soaring. There are now more than 210,000 cases in the Lone Star State. The state reported a record 10,000+ on Tuesday, July 7. Texas joined New York and Florida as the only other states to break the 10,000 daily case threshold. That's more single-day cases than any European nation ever reported at the height of their outbreaks and nearly as much as South Korea has reported the entire pandemic.

**How many more cases will the state see?**

### Texas' testing capacity

Texas appears to be lagging behind other populous states in testing for COVID-19. Public testing is available in San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Houston, and more than 11,000 people have been tested in Texas as of March 24. Abbott said he expects the state to start testing 10,000 people weekly and is expecting 15,000 test kits from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

### Comparison with other US states

Texas ranked 3rd worst state in U.S. when fighting coronavirus

**Should Texans panic**

Texas is heading down a dangerous path, local leaders warn as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations surge.

## **Project Name - The Rise of Google**

### **Introduction**

Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies alongside Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

The aim of my story is to show how Google rose amongst the world's topmost companies and show their journey. The story will also highlight various products by Google such as Youtube and Google Play.

**Google's history**

In this section I will gather information about how Google started its journey and what brought it to life. 

### **Next few sections will cover Facts and Statistics about Google's growth**

**Financial analysis of Google**

 * Alphabet's annual revenue from 2002 to 2019.

 * Google's Quarterly revenue from 2008.

 * Google cloud revenue from 2017 to 2019.

 * Google's advertising revenue from 2001 to 2019.

**Google's market value with other companies**

Market capitalization of biggest internet companies.

**Google Advertisement**
This section will show how Google began selling advertising through a program called Google AdWords. It offered marketers the opportunity to purchase relevant keywords that appear next to search results. The revenue from these ad sales helped propel Google to one of the richest companies in the world.

**Google's search engine**

Google's market share of search engine from 2010.

**Google vs. Microsoft Advertising**

This statistic shows the mobile search click share of Google and Microsoft Advertising in the United States as of the first quarter of 2020, sorted by device. 

**How Google is brining people together**

In this section I will highligth some of Google's contributions in brining billions and billions of people together on various platforms.

**Closing points / Closing**

Finally, I will all tie this up together to show how Google has changed people's live with its growth and success. What kind of impact does Google have on a normal person's life on a day to day basis.


### **Tools that I plan on using**

 * I shall be documenting my project in Shorthand tool. Their templates allow for elegant and simple stories that any novice could quickly master creating, as well as the option for more technically nuanced approaches to create slick and professional designs.
 
 * To document my ideas and initial sketches, I have used Balsamiq.
 
 * I plan on using Datawrapper and Flourish Studio for final project sketches.

### **Dataset**

I discovered a great website www.statista.com that has quite a lot of dataset for this topic. This website provides free as well as paid data. I am relying on the material that's available for no cost.

So far I have gathered the following datasets that would appropriately fit my story and visuals.

### **Initial sketches / wireframes / visuals**

I used Balsamiq (my latest favorite tool) to frame my ideas in asequence. Please find below the Balsamiq flow that is my wireframe for the initial fraft of this project. It contains my initial sketches and ideas.

I have also added the wireframe as a pdf: ([Data visualization final project wireframe.pdf](https://github.com/ankita-cmu/Data-viz-finalproject/files/4997547/Data.visualization.final.project.wireframe.pdf)
).

### **User research and interviews**

To conduct the interview and research, I picked two of my family members and a friend. I showed them the above Balsamiq project and asked them the interview questions that I had scripted. I have documented the initial setup and interview session below.

**Script and questions:**

I created a wireframe in Balsamiq with the initial sketches and layout of the project and showed to my interviewees. I did not share my project title. I wanted them to guess the topic based on my sketches and visuals. The idea was for them to guess the topic, suggest improvements, and be my critique.

Premise /setup:
Showed a draft presentation of my project visuals and informed that they were looking at my initial sketches of Telling Stories with Data coursework's final project. I created a set of seven interview questions.

 1.  What do you think is the topic of my project?

 2.  Do you think I should include more history of Google?
 
 3. What other sub-topics could be relevant for this project* 

 4. Could you please critique my sketches?
  
 5. Do you like the story telling platform that I have chosen? 
 
 6. Could you please ctitique the content? 
 
 7. Do you have any suggestions for the overall project?
