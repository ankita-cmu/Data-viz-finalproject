Telling Stories with data final project

## Project Name - The Rise and Evolution of Google

### Introduction

Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies alongside Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

The aim of my story is to show how Google rose amongst the world's topmost companies and show their journey. The story will also highlight various products by Google such as Youtube and Google Play.

### Tools that I plan on using
I shall be documenting my project in Shorthand tool.

### Dataset

I discovered a great website www.statista.com that has quite a lot of dataset for this topic. This website provides free as well as paid data. I am relying on the material that's available for no cost.

So far I have gathered the following datasets that would appropriately fit my story and visuals.

### Initial sketches / wireframes / visuals

I used Balsamiq (my latest favorite tool) to frame my ideas in asequence. Please find below the Balsamiq flow that is my wireframe for the initial fraft of this project. It contains my initial sketches and ideas.

I have also added the wireframe as a pdf: ([Data visualization final project wireframe.pdf](https://github.com/ankita-cmu/Data-viz-finalproject/files/4997547/Data.visualization.final.project.wireframe.pdf)
).

### User research and interviews

To conduct the interview and research, I picked two of my family members and a friend. I showed them the above Balsamiq project and asked them the interview questions that I had scripted. I have documented the initial setup and interview session below.

**Script and questions:**

I created a wireframe in Balsamiq with the initial sketches and layout of the project and showed to my interviewees. I did not share my project title. I wanted them to guess the topic based on my sketches and visuals. The idea was for them to guess the topic, suggest improvements, and be my critique.

Premise /setup:
Showed a draft presentation of my project visuals and informed that they were looking at my initial sketches of Telling Stories with Data coursework's final project. 

#### First interviewee - An anonymous friend:
 
 1.  What do you think is the topic of my project?

 Answer: The sketches explain the growth of Google with time. Is that your project?

*I told that this was pretty close. I am showing the rise of Google.*

 2.  Do you think I should include more history of Google?
 
 Answer: You should have a couple of visuals related to the history.

 3. What other sub-topics could be relevant for this project*

 Answer: I think you have covered most of the topics. Elaorate them in your final story.

 4. Could you please critique my sketches?
 
 Answer:
 
 5. Do you like the story telling platform that I have chosen?
 
 Answer: Shorthand sounds good. You should also try a platform called Storybird.
 
 *My answer: I plan on using a story telling tool called Shorthand for my project, do you have any suggestions?*
